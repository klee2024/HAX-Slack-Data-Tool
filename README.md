# HAX-Slack-Data-Tool

**Key Objective: **

Build new investor relationships and attract new startup program applicants. 

**Project Description:**

I created an integrated Google Sheets data tool for HAX that tracks messages in Slack channels that are relevant to HAX's investment thesis and industries of interest. 

**Functionality:**

An associate can run the script, open the Google Sheets dashboard, and view new posts, files, and DMs in Slack groups such as GenZ-VC, hwstartup, etc. The associate can flag users as investors or founders, which automatically updates corresponding investor and founder sheets with contact information. I intend to add functionality to automatically send messages to investors and founders once their message from Slack has been tagged. 

**Data Tools Used:**

Python NumPy and Pandas, Google Drive API, Google Sheets API, GSpread, PhantomBuster
